## Setup & Installation ‚öôÔ∏è

Follow these steps to run the project locally:

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/vaarrun009/AI_Resume_Builder.git
    cd AI_Resume_Builder
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment:**
    ```bash
    # Linux/macOS
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate

    # Windows
    python -m venv venv
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    ```

3.  **Install Python dependencies:**
    *(Make sure you have created a `requirements.txt` file first: `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

4.  **Install Playwright browsers:**
    *(Playwright library should be in requirements.txt)*
    ```bash
    playwright install
    ```
    *(This might take a few minutes as it downloads browser binaries)*

5.  **Place your background video:**
    * Ensure your `background.mp4` (or appropriately named video file) is located in the `static/` directory.

6.  **Run the application:**
    ```bash
    export FLASK_APP=flask_app.py # Linux/macOS
    export FLASK_ENV=development # Optional: enables debug mode

    # set FLASK_APP=flask_app.py # Windows (cmd)
    # $env:FLASK_APP = "flask_app.py" # Windows (PowerShell)
    # set FLASK_ENV=development # Windows

    flask run
    ```
    *(Alternatively, if your `flask_app.py` has `if __name__ == '__main__': app.run(...)`, you can just run `python flask_app.py`)*

7.  **Open your browser** and navigate to `http://127.0.0.1:5000` (or the address provided by Flask).
